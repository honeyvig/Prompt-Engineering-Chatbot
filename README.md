# Prompt-Engineering-Chatbot
Need a LLM to be prompt engineered as if someone was talking to a friend. You will need to prepare the prompts and test thoroughly, set up a url for me and others to test with a simple UI, prepare to have it integrated with the backend of my app, create a unique session I’d for each user which we will use the login for the app, and also deploy a DB on Aws where can we store conversation history of users.  Going with llama 3.1 and we will use that on groq. 
---------
To create a system with a friendly conversational style using Llama 3.1, integrated with a backend for user authentication, conversation history storage on AWS, and a simple UI for testing, we need to approach the problem step-by-step. Here’s a comprehensive guide, broken into several parts:
1. Set Up Backend with Llama 3.1 on Groq

Assuming you want to use the Llama 3.1 model on Groq (which is an AI accelerator), you'll need to follow these steps:

    Model Deployment: First, you need to deploy the Llama 3.1 model on the Groq platform. This typically involves setting up the model on Groq hardware or using a pre-configured service offered by Groq. Groq accelerators are optimized for AI models, but this step assumes you already have Groq integration set up and the Llama 3.1 model fine-tuned or ready for inference.

    Set Up a REST API for Llama 3.1:
        We will use FastAPI or Flask to create a RESTful API to interface with Llama 3.1.
        The API will handle incoming user messages, pass them to the model for inference, and return responses.

pip install fastapi uvicorn boto3

2. AWS Integration for Storing Conversations

To store user conversation history in AWS RDS (PostgreSQL), we’ll integrate the FastAPI app with a database to store each user's session and conversations.
3. Create a Simple UI for Testing

The UI will be a simple frontend using HTML and JavaScript to interact with the FastAPI backend.
4. Backend: FastAPI, AWS Integration, and Llama 3.1
a. FastAPI Backend for Llama 3.1 Integration

from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel
import boto3
import uuid
import openai
import psycopg2
import os

# Setup FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# AWS RDS credentials and connection details
RDS_HOST = "your-rds-endpoint"
RDS_USER = "your-db-username"
RDS_PASSWORD = "your-db-password"
RDS_DATABASE = "your-database-name"

# Initialize the OpenAI API
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'  # For Llama 3.1, assuming OpenAI API or Groq equivalent

# Connection to AWS PostgreSQL DB
def connect_to_db():
    conn = psycopg2.connect(
        host=RDS_HOST,
        database=RDS_DATABASE,
        user=RDS_USER,
        password=RDS_PASSWORD
    )
    return conn

# Pydantic model for user messages
class Message(BaseModel):
    user_id: str
    text: str

# Endpoint for generating Llama 3.1 response and saving conversation
@app.post("/send_message")
async def send_message(message: Message):
    # Get the conversation history from the database
    conn = connect_to_db()
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    cursor.execute("SELECT conversation_history FROM users WHERE user_id = %s", (message.user_id,))
    history = cursor.fetchone()
    
    if history:
        conversation_history = history[0]
    else:
        conversation_history = ""
    
    # Construct the prompt
    conversation_history += f"User: {message.text}\nAI:"
    
    # Make request to Llama 3.1 model
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # Change to Groq Llama 3.1 when integrated
        prompt=conversation_history,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    ai_response = response['choices'][0]['text'].strip()
    
    # Save conversation history back to database
    conversation_history += f" {ai_response}\n"
    
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (user_id, conversation_history) VALUES (%s, %s) ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE SET conversation_history = %s", 
                   (message.user_id, conversation_history, conversation_history))
    
    conn.commit()
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    
    return {"response": ai_response}

# A simple welcome endpoint
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to the Llama 3.1 powered chatbot!"}

Explanation:

    /send_message endpoint: Accepts a message from the user, retrieves the conversation history from AWS RDS, generates a new response using Llama 3.1 (via OpenAI API or Groq equivalent), and stores the updated conversation history in the database.
    Database Schema: The users table would have a user_id column and a conversation_history column to track the entire conversation with each user.

b. AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) Setup:

    Create an RDS instance in the AWS console (PostgreSQL engine).
    Set up a table users for storing conversations:

CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    conversation_history TEXT
);

c. UI for User Interaction:

The UI will allow users to interact with the model and view responses.

Create a basic HTML file for the frontend (e.g., index.html):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Chatbot UI</title>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
    <style>
        .chat-box {
            width: 300px;
            height: 400px;
            overflow-y: auto;
            border: 1px solid #ccc;
            padding: 10px;
            margin-bottom: 10px;
        }
        .chat-box p {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 5px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="chat-box" id="chat-box"></div>
    <input type="text" id="user-input" placeholder="Type your message" />
    <button onclick="sendMessage()">Send</button>

    <script>
        function sendMessage() {
            var userMessage = $('#user-input').val();
            var userId = 'user123'; // In a real scenario, dynamically fetch the logged-in user id.

            $.ajax({
                url: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/send_message',
                type: 'POST',
                contentType: 'application/json',
                data: JSON.stringify({ user_id: userId, text: userMessage }),
                success: function(data) {
                    $('#chat-box').append('<p><strong>You:</strong> ' + userMessage + '</p>');
                    $('#chat-box').append('<p><strong>AI:</strong> ' + data.response + '</p>');
                    $('#user-input').val('');
                    $('#chat-box').scrollTop($('#chat-box')[0].scrollHeight);
                }
            });
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>

This simple frontend allows users to type messages, send them to the backend, and display responses in the chat box.
5. Run and Test Locally:

To run the FastAPI app locally:

uvicorn main:app --reload

Open index.html in a browser, and you should be able to interact with your Llama 3.1 model.
6. Deploy the Application:

    Deploy the FastAPI backend:
        You can deploy the FastAPI app on AWS EC2, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
        Make sure you configure the Groq AI hardware integration for inference.
    Deploy the UI:
        Host the frontend on a simple web server or AWS S3 for static websites.

7. Session Management:

In the backend, each user session is linked to the user_id that you provide. You can use an authentication system (JWT, OAuth, etc.) to manage user logins and sessions.
8. Production Considerations:

    Scaling: If you expect high traffic, deploy using Docker and Kubernetes for scaling.
    Security: Use HTTPS for secure communication between the frontend and backend.
    Monitoring: Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging the API requests.

This structure sets up a simple, friendly conversational interface with Llama 3.1, session management, and backend storage of conversation history on AWS. It can be extended and enhanced with more advanced features like sentiment analysis, personalized responses, and more robust security.
